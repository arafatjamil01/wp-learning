Learning WordPress and keeping notes in the process.

## Why this repository?

This repository is for keeping some code snippets, related support excerpts, links to articles, or some personal daily use code reference, best practices or anything that seems to come handy in 
future.

I wll keep adding more contents as I keep learning those concepts.
